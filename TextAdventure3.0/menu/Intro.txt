In this desolate world, a great evil reigns everywhere...
People from all ages enlist themselves on the Special Landing-Force Academy, or SLAY for short 
Where they learn the basics of special operations: 
Demon Hunting.
You have survived 3 years of training and you were dispatched to a city named Eldria
A seaside city that used to be the trading center of the world.
Now plaged with hundreds of demons, you know for sure that the city has seen better days even if it's your first time there.
- "ATENTION!!!"
A voice pierces the whole city like a thunderclap.
You run to fall in line with other soldiers and realize that only the newcommers are lined up...
The lieutenant continues:
- "Here's the current situation, we have lost all of out high command to the demons"
- "It seems like the big one is hidding on the governor's mansion"
- "We haven't yet raid that facility because it has a high security system and" 
- "The only way to open it it's with a magnetic key"
- "That's hidden somewhere in the basement of the Governor's mansion." 
- "We do not know how deep is that basement, hundreds of demons have nested in there."
- "Your mission is to go down and retrieve the key. That's all."
The lieutenant then starts walking and is stopping at each one of the soldiers,
Asking something but you can't hear what.
Suddenly the liteutenant stops in front of you and says in a very calm voice:
- "At ease private. I'm currently the highest ranking officer alive and as you can see"
- "Protocol does not matter much at this time, you guys are"
- "My only hope to go back to my family, if they are still alive..."
- "Tell me private, what's your name?"
