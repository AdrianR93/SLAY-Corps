- "What a weird name private... you are not from around here right?"
- "Anyway, we have prepared basic equipment for you guys, tell me, What profession did you specialize in when you were at the academy?"

[1]. Soldier   They have high HP pool and their damage output is the best. Their faith is low.
[2]. Hunter    The Hunters are a well balanced class and they excel on parrying the enemy.
[3]. Priest    For a priest to be here is very brave on its own, and the healing powers on them are far superior compared to his peers.

- "Well congratulations, from now on, you are a SLAY Soldier... See you later private."
- "I see, from now on, you are a SLAY Hunter... Keep both eyes wide open out there."
- "Hmm ok then, rom now on, you are a SLAY Priest... May god guide your soul."
