You open the gate of the Gov's mansion, expecting a horde of demons and creatures, but instead is all burned up...
The stench of burnt skin and metal resonates in your mouth, dead bodies everywhere but not a demon in sight...
You approach that shadow slowly and realize that bodies on the ground have the SLAY uniform!
You are in a death trap, and possibly you are not the first! you quickly go back to the door you came in through
But a big white horse with black crin and a man on a black robe holding a scythe is standing there
Inside the robe you can see a face as withe as a bone... a Pale Rider is blocking the entrance.
The Pale Rider won't let you escape, your only way out is fighting!
