You exit the mansion all covered in blood
The Liteunant runs towards you to check on you,

- "Private! What were you doing in there all alone?!"
- "I told you that we will raid it with the whole brigade!!!"

Your vision is getting blurry...
You body is injured, you can barely speak let alone argue with someone

- "...Just doing my job, sir."

The Liteunant sees you surprised,  and with the face red holding tears you can barely hear:

- "You're goddamn right private, I mean... Sarge"

The Liteunant drops you on the floor and salutes you.
You can see nothing, can't speak or hear nothing anymore, but until the very end you are a S.L.A.Y. soldier.
You stand up and salute.

"...Ye.. Yes, sir.".
